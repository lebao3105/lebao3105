## Hi there!

I'm Le Bao Nguyen, a Vietnamese developer+student.

## Anything here?

My {,forked,archived} code:)

They are vary speaking of used programming languages: Pascal (rarely, no new projects w/ it), C++, C#, and Python (which I do not use anymore), TypeScript (not presented here).

All are not very actively developed like they were years ago, some even got archived/deleted due to themself being impractical & time-wasting.
Some are simply too hard for me to do alone. ***(as I mostly do stuff myself)***

Below are projects that you might want to take a look at, although this should be done in my website:

## First projects

* Textworker (formerly `texteditor`): A text editor. Formerly to be written in Python, it now has a space on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/textworker). Archived;
* App1cli: My first project **ever**. Check it [out](https://github.com/lebao3105/app1cli).

## Past projects

* [LFSBuild](https://github.com/lebao3105/lfsbuild): Linux From Scratch build scripts - partially complete. Archived;
* [BleachBit](https://github.com/lebao3105/bleachbit): BleachBit the file system cleaner, with wxPython for maximum happiness that you do NOT have to pack bunch of GTK files. Almost complete. Archived;
* [Swifile](https://github.com/lebao3105/Swifile-FileManager): A file manager for iOS, it (optionally) uses Pascal! Will never be completed. Archived;
* Some {,forked} iOS tweaks and such. All are archived as I do not use iOS anymore (unwillingly);
* [Charms Bar port](https://github.com/lebao3105/charms-bar-port) and [CMDInjector](https://github.com/lebao3105/CMD.Injector). Two of my biggest attempts in writing code.

## Current projects

* [Windows8Group](https://github.com/windows8group)'s WhatsWin: A WhatsApp client for Windows Phone 8.1+;
* [LocalTalk](https://github.com/lebao3105/LocalTalk): LocalSend for Windows Phone 8.1+. No, literally - it implements LocalSend's protocol;
* [CommandsCollection](https://github.com/lebao3105/Commands-collection): A collection of commands, written in Pascal;
* Some in my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lebao3105).

My personal website is [here](https://lebao3105.github.io).

This repository (lebao3105/lebao3105) has some [dotfiles](dotfiles/) for Linux desktops.
