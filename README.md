## Hi there!

I'm Le Bao Nguyen, a ~~16~~ 17 y/o Vietnamese. I have interests in computer stuff, mostly softwares.

I'm a developer myself.

## Anything here?

My {,forked,archived} code:)

Many projects are archived due to many reasons, such as impractical or takes too much times (as I write them all by **myself**).

However, there are projects on my personal GitLab, check [them](https://gitlab.com/lebao3105) out!

One of my first projects, texteditor - which is now textworker, has its own [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/textworker).

I have projects for iOS (jailbroken one), desktop and cross-platform (mobile & desktop). This repository has dotfiles for Linux/BSD desktop. r/unixporn stuff;)

My personal website: https://lebao3105.github.io
