## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Le Bao Nguyen, a 15 y/o Vietnamese. I have interests in:

* Programming
* Operating systems: Historical/Hobby OSes are quite beautiful:>
* Beautify my desktop
* Any other cool stuff:3

**I'm currently learning to:**

* Maybe learn to use web technologies? I don't have any idea about this
* Improve my English
* Improve my programming skills

## What's here?

My (forked) code, of course:)

There are some iOS tweaks such as SBarOverride (selfmade) and Little12 (forked from Ryan Nair). Their debs are placed in my [repo](https://lebao3105.github.io/repo), try!

Also my desktop projects - in Python, C#, C++ (just one), Pascal.

My personal website, err outdated: https://lebao3105.github.io/.

This lebao3105/lebao3105 repo? Not only this profile README, I also have dotfiles for Linux desktop!
